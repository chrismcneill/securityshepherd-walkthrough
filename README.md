# securityshepherd-walkthrough
Walkthrough videos/instructions for SecurityShepherd.

*Don't cheat!*
Please don't use this as a way to cheat through the levels/challenges
The information here should only be used as a last resort if you are stuck and have run out of all ideas to get past the current level you are on.

Use the walkthrough to try and understand how you should be thinking when looking at various scenarios, and as a method to help you pick up different techniques that may be useful in different challenges.


> *Q:* _Why provide lesson/challenge walk through instructions if you don't 
> want everyone to use them to get the answers?_
> 
> *A:* I feel that it is better that someone is helped through a challenge that they are stuck on so they can learn and understand another way to think  of the problem at hand, and use it in future challenges and daily security checks. Not providing these may result in people getting frustrated at some levels, and giving up - which then doesn't help anyone.

## Known Issues

The “*Reverse Engineer 1*” challenge under the _Corporal_ training section has a bug in it where the instructions (and/or) the actual solution are incorrect therefore making them not match up. This has been raised with the OWASP Security Shepherd project (https://github.com/OWASP/SecurityShepherd/issues/283) and they are looking into it.
